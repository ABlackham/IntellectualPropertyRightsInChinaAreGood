      >China's Intellectual Property Rights are not the best, but they are improving. They work, not well, but they do, and they will work well when they improve. Several improvements have already been made, but there are still many issues with them. Now that they're improving their rights, they will end up working better than before. Overall, the Chinese Intellectual Protection Rights are good, heading straight for great.</h1>*
